Golabs for Test Driven Development

This is a very simple exercise implementing a calculator function that demostrates TDD in go.  

Ideal TDD way.  
1.When we get specs from a client,collaborate with the Business owner and write down a skeletal structure for specs as per the acceptance criteria  
(https://github.com/kaddiya/golabs-tdd/pull/1)  

2.Once this skeletal structure is ready,start implementing features  
3.For the first feature expand on the test case/spec to show the expected that compiles the code but fails the test because the logic hasnt been implemented properly  
(https://github.com/kaddiya/golabs-tdd/pull/2/files)  
4.Once this failing test is in place,write code in the actual package that allows the test written in #3 to be passed  
(https://github.com/kaddiya/golabs-tdd/pull/3)  

5.iterate 3-4 for every such feature and specs enumerated in #2.
